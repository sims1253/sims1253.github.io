      <h1>The Birth of a coala</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 30, 2017</p>

<p>This is my first entry on the coala blog. Welcome everyone.
My name is Maximilian and I am the community team leader for coala since
December. In this post I want to talk about the teams in coala and
especially about the community team, its members and our work so far.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="teams-in-coala">Teams in coala</h2>

<p>I had the idea for the teams around EuroPython 2016 as a way to take part of
the organisatory burden from Lasse. At that time he was making almost all the
meaningful decisions in coala, not because he wanted to, but because
everyone asked him. This meant that Lasse had almost no time to do anything
besides organization and management stuff. Considering that he is one of our
more experienced developers that sounds like a waste of potential. Not to say
that he wasn’t doing an awesome job managing everything, but maybe someone
else could take on the management role and free some of Lasse’s time up for
developing again. Thus the teams idea was born.
Having team leaders that take over parts of the management burden associated
with their team’s scope would leave Lasse more free time, add more voices
and brains to decisions and diversify our “leadership rank”. In the end
Monolythic management can only get you so far. If you want to read more about
the structure of teams in coala you can take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0003.md">teams cEP</a></p>

<h2 id="meet-the-community-team">Meet the community Team</h2>

<p>I started recruiting members right after the election was over and found
a number of like-minded coalians that were interested in community work in
the broader sense.
We have Lasse, who has his fingers everywhere but especially wanted to help
with the GSoC again.
Mariatta, yeay an imdb star!, who is interested in the wellbeing of
the community and the newcomer experience, Hemang, our frontend guru, Kaisar
the backend equivalent and Udayan who will work on administering RGSoC
(besides being the Research team leader, awesome!).</p>

<p>Together we have many ideas on how to improve and grow a healthy community.
Creating a welcoming environment where everyone feels welcome, a place where
we can teach and learn from each other, a place where we can exchange mutual
interests, a place to grow as professionals and humans.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-achieved-so-far">What we achieved so far</h2>

<p>This section is part of a activity report we wanted to implement for all
teams. Partly to create a mechanism of control for the rest of the coala
community but mainly to give the teams a place and platform to talk about
the awesome stuff they create and work on.</p>

<p>The first thing that I would claim for the community team would be the
creation of the teams cEP, election for team leaders and all together the
creation of the coala teams. While the cEP was written by me I had great
reviewers. I wanted to list them here but looking at the PRs, that would
be too many names. We had 7 leader applications for 6 teams and
recently we added the review team with another Max as leader.</p>

<p>After that Mariatta added the <a href="http://coala.io/coc">Code of Conduct</a> which
was lacking until then.
This enabled Udayan to apply coala for the RGSoC, which just got accepted.
YEAY!</p>

<p>After that we finally got our call for participation out so all the
coalians who want to become team members knew it was possible. We got a
lot of applications and so far it looks promising.</p>

<p>And finally Hemang and Kaisar wove their web-dev magic (dark arts if you ask
me) and created not only a new <a href="http://coala.io">landing page</a> but also
this awesome <a href="https://projects.coala.io">projects page</a>. Although evil
tongues claim the landing page was not only a community team effort I claim
that all your page are belong to us.</p>

<p>You should definitely check out all the cool stuff created and give some love
to the members of this awesome team.</p>

<h2 id="whats-coming-up-next">What’s coming up next</h2>

<p>We are in the process of finalizing our GSoC application but there will be a
blog post about that in the future I guess. Let’s just say that the new
projects page will hopefully help us a lot (and everyone else who decides to
use it. Open source baby!) and we have some exciting projects and
collaborations in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Besides the huge GSoC effort, I am in the process of rewriting the
<a href="https://github.com/coala/cEPs/pull/62">members cEP</a>, which includes some
major changes to our newcomer guide and we are working on improving the
communication for maintainers. Hopefully this will be the done until our
next post.</p>

<p>If you have ideas, questions, comments or other input, visit us in our
<a href="https://gitter.im/coala/community">gitter channel</a> or drop us an email
under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">community at coala.io</code>.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Your Community Team</p>
